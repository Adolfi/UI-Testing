# UI Testing
A repository with various test examples using different UI testing frameworks.
All these projects includes the exact same tests againts the same [website](https://adolfi.dev).
The idea behind having all the same tests but with different frameworks in one repository is to easily compare different frameworks so that you may find the framework that feels right to you. **There is no right or wrong framework!** We all come from different backgrounds and different things that floats our boat.
