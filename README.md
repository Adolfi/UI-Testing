# UI Testing
A repository with different testing examples using different UI testing frameworks.
All these projects includes the same tests againts the exact same [website](https://adolfi.dev).
The idea behind having all the same tests but with different frameworks in one repository is to easily compare different frameworks and find your favourite.
